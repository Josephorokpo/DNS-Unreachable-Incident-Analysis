# **Cybersecurity Incident Report: DNS Unreachable Error**

## **Incident Summary**

Customers of a client company reported being unable to access their website, www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and received a "destination port unreachable" error message. As a cybersecurity analyst, I confirmed the issue and initiated an investigation by analyzing network traffic, specifically focusing on DNS and ICMP protocols.

## **1\. Problem Summary from tcpdump Log Analysis**

### **Overview of tcpdump Log Analysis:**

The tcpdump log provided a clear view of the network traffic when attempting to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com. The analysis revealed a consistent pattern of outgoing DNS queries (UDP protocol) to the DNS server, followed immediately by error responses (ICMP protocol) from that same DNS server.

### **Details Indicated in the Log:**

* **Initial Request:** The log shows outgoing UDP packets from my computer's IP (192.51.100.15) to the DNS server's IP (203.0.113.2) on port 53, requesting the A record for yummyrecipesforme.com.  
  * *Example Entry (first line):* 13:24:32.192571 IP 192.51.100.15.35084 \> 203.0.113.2.domain: 35084+ A? yummyrecipesforme.com. (37)  
* **Error Response:** Immediately following each UDP query, an ICMP packet is received from the DNS server (203.0.113.2) back to my computer (192.51.100.15).  
  * *Example Entry (third line):* 13:24:32.192661 IP 203.0.113.2 \> 192.51.100.15: ICMP host 203.0.113.2 udp port 53 unreachable  
* **Repeated Errors:** The log indicates that this pattern of failed UDP DNS queries and ICMP "port unreachable" responses occurred repeatedly.  
* **Timestamps:** Each entry includes a precise timestamp, showing the exact time of the event (e.g., 13:24:32.192571).

### **Interpretation of Issues Found in the Log:**

The consistent "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP error message is the critical indicator. This message signifies that while the DNS server at 203.0.113.2 is reachable at the network level (meaning the ICMP response itself could be sent), there is **no service listening on UDP port 53** at that destination. UDP port 53 is the standard port for DNS queries. Therefore, the DNS server is unable to process the incoming requests to resolve yummyrecipesforme.com's IP address.

## **2\. Analysis of Data and Proposed Solution**

### **When the Problem Was First Reported:**

The earliest timestamp in the provided tcpdump log indicating the issue is 13:24:32.192661, which corresponds to the first ICMP "port unreachable" message. This suggests the problem was actively occurring around **1:24 p.m. and 32 seconds**.

### **Scenario, Events, and Symptoms Identified:**

* **Scenario:** A client's website (www.yummyrecipesforme.com) is inaccessible to customers.  
* **Events:** Customers reported "destination port unreachable" errors. My own attempt to visit the website yielded the same error.  
* **Symptoms:**  
  * Website www.yummyrecipesforme.com is unreachable.  
  * Browser displays "destination port unreachable" error.  
  * tcpdump log shows outgoing UDP DNS queries to 203.0.113.2 on port 53\.  
  * tcpdump log shows incoming ICMP responses from 203.0.113.2 with the message "udp port 53 unreachable."

### **Current Status of the Issue:**

The issue has been identified as a problem with the DNS service on the client's DNS server. This event has been reported to the security engineers, who are now handling the management and resolution of the incident. My role as an analyst at this stage is focused on assessment and reporting.

### **Information Discovered While Investigating:**

The investigation, through tcpdump log analysis, revealed that the client's DNS server at 203.0.113.2 is not responding to DNS queries on UDP port 53\. This is evidenced by the "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP messages. This means that client machines cannot resolve the domain name yummyrecipesforme.com to its corresponding IP address, thus preventing them from initiating an HTTPS connection to the web server. The different protocols involved (UDP for DNS query, ICMP for error) indicate a network-level communication issue specifically related to service availability on a particular port.

### **Next Steps in Troubleshooting and Resolving the Issue:**

1. **Verify DNS Service Status:** Check if the DNS service (e.g., BIND, Microsoft DNS Server) is running on the server at 203.0.113.2.  
2. **Check Firewall Rules:** Investigate if a firewall on 203.0.113.2 or an intermediate device is blocking UDP traffic on port 53\.  
3. **Review DNS Server Configuration:** Ensure the DNS server is correctly configured to listen on port 53 and serve requests for yummyrecipesforme.com.  
4. **Resource Utilization Check:** Examine the DNS server's resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) to ensure it's not overwhelmed.  
5. **Network Connectivity Test:** Perform basic network connectivity tests (e.g., ping, traceroute) to 203.0.113.2 to confirm general reachability.  
6. **DNS Resolver Configuration:** Confirm client machines are configured to use the correct DNS server.

### **Suspected Root Cause of the Problem:**

The suspected root cause of the problem is that the **DNS service on the server at 203.0.113.2 is either not running, is misconfigured, or is being blocked by a local firewall rule**, preventing it from listening for and responding to UDP DNS queries on port 53\. This prevents domain name resolution, making www.yummyrecipesforme.com inaccessible.
